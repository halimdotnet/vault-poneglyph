# Law 8: Make Other People Come to You – Use Bait if Necessary

_"When you force the other person to act, you are the one in control. It is always better to make your opponent come to you, abandoning his own plans in the process. Lure him with fabulous gains—then attack. You hold the cards."_

## The Psychology of Pursuit and Control

### The Power Dynamic of Pursuit
- **Control through positioning**: The person being pursued holds inherent power over the pursuer
- **Initiative advantage**: When others come to you, you set the terms of engagement
- **Emotional leverage**: Being desired creates psychological superiority over those who desire
- **Strategic patience**: Waiting forces others to reveal their intentions and desperation levels

### Psychological Mechanisms of Attraction
- **Scarcity principle**: What's harder to obtain appears more valuable
- **Investment psychology**: People value more what they work harder to achieve
- **Status signaling**: Being sought after elevates your perceived importance and value
- **Validation seeking**: Humans naturally pursue approval and acceptance from high-status individuals

### The Bait Psychology
- **Desire amplification**: Well-crafted bait makes the target focus intensely on what you offer
- **Rational override**: Strong enough incentives can make people abandon logical decision-making
- **Commitment escalation**: Once people start pursuing, they invest more to justify their initial effort
- **Tunnel vision**: Focused pursuit makes people ignore risks and alternative options

### Territory and Environment Control
- **Home field advantage**: Operating from your chosen environment provides numerous tactical benefits
- **Information asymmetry**: You know your territory while visitors operate with incomplete information
- **Resource control**: Access to your resources, network, and support systems
- **Escape route management**: Easy exit strategies when you control the location and circumstances

## Conclusion and Strategic Perspective

Law 8 represents a sophisticated understanding of power dynamics and human psychology. The principle of making others come to you leverages fundamental aspects of human nature—our attraction to what's scarce, our desire for what others want, and our tendency to value what we must work to obtain.

**Core Strategic Insights**:
- **Control through positioning**: Being pursued rather than pursuing gives you inherent advantage in any interaction
- **Value amplification**: What's harder to obtain is automatically perceived as more valuable
- **Initiative management**: Letting others make the first move provides tactical and psychological advantages
- **Territory advantage**: Operating from your chosen environment enhances your effectiveness and comfort

**Critical Balance Principles**:
- **Value foundation**: Magnetic attraction must be based on genuine capability and benefit
- **Relationship consideration**: Long-term success requires balance between magnetism and active engagement
- **Cultural sensitivity**: Approach must be adapted to different social and professional contexts
- **Timing awareness**: Some situations require immediate action regardless of positioning preferences

**Modern Relevance and Digital Age Applications**:
In our networked, always-connected world, the ability to create magnetic attraction has become both more powerful and more complex. Social media and digital platforms provide new ways to demonstrate value and attract followers, but they also create expectations for more interactive and responsive engagement. The most successful modern practitioners combine magnetic positioning with strategic engagement.

**Integration with Other Laws**:
Law 8 works synergistically with other principles in Greene's framework:
- Requires Law 5 (Guard Your Reputation) as foundation for attraction
- Supports Law 6 (Court Attention) by creating sustainable visibility
- Enhances Law 1 (Never Outshine the Master) by managing how you present your desirability
- Complements Law 3 (Conceal Your Intentions) by making others reveal their needs first

**Ethical Considerations**:
While creating attraction and managing pursuit dynamics is a legitimate strategy, it must be balanced with genuine value creation and respect for others. The most sustainable magnetic positioning comes from actually being someone worth pursuing—through competence, integrity, and the ability to create mutual benefit—rather than through manipulation or artificial scarcity.

**Long-term Mastery Perspective**:
Ultimate mastery of this law means developing such genuine value and appeal that people naturally seek you out, while also maintaining the wisdom to know when to step forward and actively engage. It's about creating a sustainable ecosystem where others want to participate while ensuring that everyone benefits from the interaction.

**The Attraction Paradox**:
The ultimate paradox of this law is that the most effective way to make others come to you is often to become someone who doesn't need them to come to you. When you're genuinely fulfilled, capable, and valuable on your own, others naturally want to be part of your world. The master of this law creates attraction not through neediness or manipulation, but through abundance and authentic worth.

**Future-Oriented Application**:
As work and relationships become increasingly networked and digital, the ability to create sustainable attraction becomes even more valuable. Those who master this law in the modern context will be able to build influential platforms, valuable networks, and meaningful relationships while maintaining the autonomy and control that comes from being sought after rather than seeking.

Remember that the goal is not to become isolated or passive, but to position yourself so strategically that others naturally want to engage with you. The most successful application creates situations where both parties benefit—you gain the advantages of being pursued, while others gain access to genuine value and opportunity.
