# Law 2: Never Put Too Much Trust in Friends, Learn How to Use Enemies

_"Be wary of friends—they will betray you more quickly, for they are easily aroused to envy. They also become spoiled and tyrannical. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more to prove. In fact, you have more to fear from friends than from enemies."_

## The Psychology Behind This Counterintuitive Law

### The Hidden Dangers of Friendship
- **Entitlement syndrome**: Friends often feel they deserve special treatment and can become resentful when they don't receive it
- **Invisible envy**: Your success can trigger deep-seated jealousy in friends who compare themselves to you
- **Intimacy weaponized**: Friends know your vulnerabilities and can use them against you more effectively than strangers
- **Ownership mentality**: Friends may feel they "helped create" your success and demand their share

### The Power of Converted Enemies
- **Proving ground motivation**: Former enemies work harder to demonstrate their newfound loyalty
- **No sense of entitlement**: They don't expect special privileges and are grateful for opportunities
- **Deeper appreciation**: They value the second chance you've given them more than friends value your continued loyalty
- **Psychological transformation**: Converting an enemy provides a profound sense of control and achievement

### Fundamental Human Psychology
- **Crab bucket mentality**: Friends often pull you down when you try to rise above them
- **Cognitive dissonance theory**: People become more committed to something they've had to fight for
- **Reciprocity principle**: Unexpected kindness creates powerful psychological obligations
- **Status anxiety**: Changes in power dynamics threaten established friendships

## Historical Examples and Case Studies

### The Betrayal of Michael III by Basilius (Byzantine Empire)
**Background**: Emperor Michael III elevated his childhood friend Basilius from stable boy to co-emperor in 9th century Byzantium.

**The Friend's Betrayal**:
- Basilius felt entitled to power due to their friendship
- He began plotting to seize complete control
- Used intimate knowledge of Michael's weaknesses to manipulate him
- Eventually murdered Michael and took the throne

**The Lesson**: Basilius exploited the trust and intimacy of friendship as weapons to destroy the very person who had elevated him.

### Abraham Lincoln's Mastery with Edwin Stanton
**The Setup**: Edwin Stanton had publicly humiliated Lincoln, calling him a "gorilla" and ridiculing him as a backwoods lawyer.

**Lincoln's Strategic Response**:
- Instead of seeking revenge, Lincoln appointed Stanton as Secretary of War
- Gave Stanton the opportunity to prove his worth and loyalty
- Transformed his harshest critic into his most dedicated supporter

**The Transformation**:
- Stanton became one of Lincoln's most loyal and effective cabinet members
- Worked with extraordinary dedication to prove Lincoln's wisdom in choosing him
- When Lincoln died, Stanton famously said: "Now he belongs to the angels"

**Strategic Insight**: By converting an enemy, Lincoln gained not just an ally, but someone with a personal investment in vindicating Lincoln's judgment.

### Talleyrand's Service to Napoleon
**Context**: Talleyrand had served various regimes before Napoleon, including some hostile to Napoleon's rise.

**The Conversion**:
- Napoleon "forgave" Talleyrand's past allegiances and gave him a crucial position
- Talleyrand became Napoleon's most valuable diplomat
- His loyalty proved more reliable than many of Napoleon's old allies
- The relationship lasted longer than many friendships from Napoleon's early days

### Additional Historical Patterns
- **Julius Caesar**: Often promoted former enemies to key positions while being betrayed by close friends like Brutus
- **Franklin Roosevelt**: Successfully integrated former political opponents into his administration
- **Corporate leaders**: Many successful CEOs have hired executives from rival companies who initially opposed them

## Contemporary Applications

**Recruitment and Hiring Strategy**:
- Consider candidates from competitor companies who initially criticized your organization

## Implementation Strategies

### Managing Friends Wisely

1. **Explicit rules**: Create clear guidelines about mixing friendship and business
2. **Realistic expectations**: Communicate that friendship doesn't guarantee privileges

**With Former Enemies**:
- "I respect the perspective you brought to our previous disagreements..."
- "I'd like to explore how we might work together constructively"
- "Your skills would be valuable to our organization"
- "I believe we can accomplish more as partners than as adversaries"

## Conclusion and Strategic Perspective

Law 2 challenges our cultural assumptions about friendship and enmity. Greene argues that the emotional dynamics inherent in friendship—expectations, jealousy, entitlement—often make friends more dangerous than enemies. Meanwhile, converted enemies have powerful psychological motivations to prove their loyalty and worth.

**Key Strategic Principles**:
- **Friendship doesn't guarantee loyalty**: Personal relationships don't ensure professional reliability
- **Converted enemies often show greater commitment**: They have more to prove and less to take for granted
- **Emotional dynamics are complex**: Understanding psychology is crucial for effective relationship management
- **Professional boundaries are essential**: Separate personal feelings from strategic decisions

**Balanced Application**:
This law isn't about becoming cynical or manipulative—it's about understanding human nature realistically. The goal is to:
- Protect yourself from unexpected betrayals
- Build stronger, more reliable alliances
- Make decisions based on merit rather than emotion
- Create more honest and productive relationships

**The Wisdom of Perspective**:
The most important insight from Law 2 is that relationships are dynamic and context-dependent. A friend in one situation might become an enemy in another, and vice versa. The wise leader understands these dynamics and adapts accordingly, while maintaining their integrity and core values.

Remember: this law is about strategic thinking in competitive environments, not about being heartless in personal relationships. The best leaders learn to navigate the complexity of human emotions and motivations with both wisdom and compassion, using these insights to build more effective and sustainable networks of support.
