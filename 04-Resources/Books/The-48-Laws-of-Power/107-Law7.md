# Law 7: Get Others to Do the Work for You, but Always Take the Credit

_"Use the wisdom, knowledge, and legwork of other people to further your own cause. Not only will such assistance save you valuable time and energy, it will give you a godlike aura of efficiency and speed. In the end your helpers will be forgotten and you will be remembered. Never do yourself what others can do for you."_

## The Psychology of Leadership and Attribution

### The Attribution Bias in Human Psychology
- **Leadership visibility**: People naturally attribute group achievements to the most visible leader figure
- **Recency effect**: Those who present final results are more memorable than those who did preliminary work
- **Simplification tendency**: Human minds prefer simple narratives with clear protagonists rather than complex group dynamics
- **Authority association**: Success is automatically linked to those in positions of formal authority

### The Efficiency Multiplication Effect
- **Cognitive leverage**: Using others' expertise allows you to operate beyond your individual capabilities
- **Time arbitrage**: Delegating frees up your time for higher-value strategic activities
- **Specialization benefits**: Others may be more skilled at specific tasks than you could ever become
- **Scale advantages**: Coordinating multiple people's efforts can achieve exponentially greater results

### Social and Organizational Dynamics
- **Hierarchical expectations**: Organizational structures naturally funnel credit upward to leaders
- **Public representation**: Leaders become the face and voice of collective achievements
- **Decision accountability**: Those who make final choices are seen as most responsible for outcomes
- **Network positioning**: Being at the center of information and coordination flows creates natural credit accumulation

### The Psychology of Subordinates
- **Security in anonymity**: Many people prefer to work behind the scenes without public accountability
- **Compensation trade-offs**: Workers often accept doing the work in exchange for stability and payment
- **Expertise satisfaction**: Specialists may find fulfillment in practicing their craft regardless of public recognition
- **Future investment**: Supporting successful leaders can create opportunities for advancement

## Historical Examples and Case Studies

### Thomas Edison: The Innovation Orchestrator
**Background**: Often called America's greatest inventor, but his genius lay more in organizing innovation than personal invention.

**The Edison System**:
- **Menlo Park Laboratory**: Created the first industrial research and development facility
- **Team recruitment**: Hired brilliant scientists and engineers like Nikola Tesla and William Sawyer
- **Process systematization**: Developed methodical approaches to invention and testing
- **Patent consolidation**: Ensured all inventions created in his labs were patented under his name

**Specific Examples**:
- **Light bulb development**: While often credited as inventor, the incandescent bulb was developed by his team with significant contributions from Lewis Latimer and others
- **Phonograph improvements**: Original concept was his, but practical development involved extensive team work
- **Motion picture technology**: Kinetoscope and early film technology developed primarily by William Kennedy Dickson
- **Electrical power systems**: Complex engineering primarily done by his team while Edison focused on business strategy

**Strategic Advantages**:
- **Public persona**: Became known as "The Wizard of Menlo Park" through careful media management
- **Business control**: Maintained ownership and direction of all projects while leveraging others' expertise
- **Scalable innovation**: Could work on multiple projects simultaneously through effective delegation
- **Market positioning**: His name became synonymous with innovation and technological progress

**Legacy and Criticism**:
- **Historical credit**: Edison's name remains attached to innovations largely developed by others
- **Team recognition**: Many brilliant contributors remained largely unknown to history
- **Ethical questions**: Some team members, particularly Tesla, left due to disputes over credit and compensation
- **Business model validation**: Demonstrated that organizing innovation could be more valuable than individual genius

**Strategic Lesson**: Edison showed that becoming known as the source of innovation could be more valuable than being the actual inventor, especially when combined with business acumen and public relations skill.

### Steve Jobs: The Vision Orchestrator
**Background**: Co-founder of Apple who became the face of the company's innovations despite relying heavily on team contributions.

**The Jobs Approach**:
- **Vision communication**: Provided overarching direction and product concepts
- **Team assembly**: Recruited exceptional talent in design, engineering, and marketing
- **Quality obsession**: Set extremely high standards that pushed teams to excel
- **Presentation mastery**: Became the exclusive public face of Apple innovations

**Key Product Developments**:
- **Original Macintosh**: Largely designed by teams led by Jef Raskin and Bill Atkinson, but Jobs received public credit
- **iPhone development**: Massive team effort involving hundreds of engineers, but Jobs became synonymous with the innovation
- **iTunes and iPod**: Significant contributions from Tony Fadell and others, orchestrated under Jobs' direction
- **Retail strategy**: Store design and customer experience largely developed by Ron Johnson's team

**Leadership Techniques**:
- **Perfectionist pressure**: Used demanding standards to extract exceptional work from teams
- **Narrative control**: Carefully managed how innovations were presented to the public
- **Detail obsession**: Involved himself in crucial decisions while delegating execution
- **Credit concentration**: Ensured that public recognition flowed primarily to him and the Apple brand

**Results and Controversies**:
- **Brand building**: Apple became one of the world's most valuable companies under his leadership
- **Innovation reputation**: Jobs became viewed as one of history's greatest innovators
- **Team tensions**: Many talented employees left due to his demanding style and credit concentration
- **Posthumous debates**: After his death, more recognition has been given to team contributors

**Strategic Insight**: Jobs demonstrated that being the orchestrator and public face of innovation could create more lasting value than being the individual contributor, but at the cost of team relationships and ethical concerns.

### Political Campaign Management: The Candidate as Credit Magnet
**Modern Campaign Dynamics**: Political campaigns represent perfect examples of this law in action.

**The Structure**:
- **Candidate visibility**: Politicians receive all public credit for campaign success
- **Team invisibility**: Strategists, speech writers, and organizers remain largely unknown
- **Hierarchical credit flow**: All achievements are attributed to the candidate regardless of actual contribution
- **Post-victory dynamics**: Electoral success is credited to the candidate, not the campaign team

**Specific Examples**:
- **Barack Obama 2008**: David Plouffe and David Axelrod architected the strategy, but Obama received credit for "running the best campaign in history"
- **Campaign messaging**: Speech writers create memorable phrases and concepts that become associated with candidates
- **Digital strategy**: Technical teams develop innovative approaches that enhance candidates' reputations for being forward-thinking
- **Ground game**: Field organizers create voter turnout operations that candidates get credit for inspiring

**Systematic Credit Capture**:
- **Media focus**: Journalists interview candidates, not their teams, creating natural credit concentration
- **Victory speeches**: Candidates accept congratulations for team achievements
- **Historical recording**: Campaign success becomes part of candidate legacy, not team recognition
- **Future opportunities**: Successful campaigns launch political careers for candidates, not necessarily for team members

**Ethical Considerations**:
- **Compensation structures**: Campaign staff are paid for their work, creating some ethical cover
- **Career advancement**: Team members may benefit from association with successful campaigns
- **Public expectations**: Voters expect candidates to take responsibility for their campaigns
- **Democratic function**: The system requires identifiable leaders for democratic accountability

## Conclusion and Strategic Perspective

Law 7 represents perhaps the most ethically complex principle in Greene's framework. While the ability to leverage others' efforts and coordinate team achievements is essential for leadership and large-scale success, the approach to credit and recognition makes the difference between effective leadership and exploitative manipulation.

**Core Strategic Insights**:
- **Leverage multiplication**: Coordinating others' efforts can achieve far more than individual work
- **Attribution psychology**: Credit naturally flows to visible leaders and coordinators
- **Efficiency advantages**: Delegation allows focus on highest-value strategic activities
- **System design**: Well-structured teams can operate effectively with appropriate leadership

**Critical Balance Principles**:
- **Mutual benefit**: Sustainable success requires team members to gain from their contributions
- **Recognition sharing**: Appropriate credit distribution motivates continued excellence
- **Ethical boundaries**: Legal and moral limits on credit concentration
- **Long-term thinking**: Reputation and relationship effects of credit practices

**Modern Leadership Evolution**:
Contemporary leadership increasingly requires collaborative approaches that share recognition while maintaining strategic direction. The most successful modern leaders understand that their role is to orchestrate success in ways that benefit everyone involved, not to extract maximum credit from others' work.

**Integration with Other Laws**:
Law 7 works synergistically with other principles:
- Requires Law 5 (Guard Your Reputation) to manage perception of fairness
- Supports Law 1 (Never Outshine the Master) by managing how you present team achievements
- Enables Law 6 (Court Attention) by providing achievements to publicize
- Must balance with Law 2 (Use Enemies) to avoid creating adversaries through unfair credit practices

**Ethical Considerations and Modern Relevance**:
In our transparent, networked world, unfair credit practices are more visible and damaging than ever before. Social media and professional networks make it easier for team members to share their own stories and for unfair attribution to be exposed. The most sustainable approach focuses on being genuinely valuable as a coordinator and leader rather than simply claiming credit for others' work.

**The Leadership Paradox**:
The ultimate paradox of this law is that the most effective way to implement it is often to give generous credit to others while quietly ensuring that your coordinating role is understood and valued. Great leaders are remembered not because they stole credit, but because they made others successful and were recognized as the architects of that success.

**Long-term Mastery Perspective**:
Mastery of this law means understanding when to step forward and when to step back, when to take credit and when to deflect it, and how to build sustainable systems where everyone benefits from collective success. The goal is not to exploit others but to create value through coordination and leadership that genuinely merits recognition.

**Future-Oriented Leadership**:
As work becomes increasingly collaborative and networked, the leaders who thrive will be those who can orchestrate distributed talent while maintaining trust and motivation. This requires moving beyond simple credit-taking toward creating platforms and systems where many people can succeed together.

Remember that the most enduring success comes not from taking credit for others' work, but from being so valuable as a leader, coordinator, and visionary that credit naturally flows to you while others are also appropriately recognized for their contributions. The master of this law creates environments where everyone wants to do their best work and where collective achievements reflect well on all participants.
